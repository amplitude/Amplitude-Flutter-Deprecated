# Warning: This Flutter SDK is deprecated!

We developed a new Flutter SDK bridging calls to our native SDKs, and this SDK won't be supported anymore. Here's the repo for the new Flutter SDK [Amplitude-Flutter-New](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-Flutter-New). The new SDK will start from v2.0.0. However, you can still continue to use version v1.4.0 which was implemented with the old style.

We made a decision because of following reasons.
1. Our native SDKs (iOS, Android) are tested throughly and trusted.
2. You will get access to much more features.
3. You will get new faetures faster if it's added to native SDKs.
4. It will save our time to duplicate logic for each APIs from native SDKs.

To migrate, since the we wrote the our API in a better way, you might need to change some API calls. Sorry for the inconvenience, but we try to make this change as fast as possible since we believe this is the right way to develop and maintain our Flutter SDK.

# amplitude_flutter

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/amplitude_flutter.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/amplitude_flutter)

The Official Amplitude Flutter plugin. Used to track events with [Amplitude](https://www.amplitude.com).

## Getting Started
To use this plugin, add `amplitude_flutter` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).

Find the [API key](https://amplitude.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/235649848-Settings#project-general-settings) for your Amplitude project under your project settings.

Import `package:amplitude_flutter/amplitude_flutter.dart`, and instantiate `AmplitudeFlutter` with your API key.

In the example below - replace the string `API_KEY` with your API Key.

In addition, a [`Config`](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-Flutter/blob/master/lib/src/config.dart) object can be passed as a constructor argument for additional options.
NOTE: This plugin's methods should only be called from the main isolate.

## Advertising Id Tracking
In iOS, to enable Advertising Id tracking, you will need to add `AdSupport.framework` in your project setting page.

In Android, firstly you need to add `com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads` as a dependency in your `build.gradle`. If you use Google Mobile Ads SDK version 17.0.0 above. You need to add [`AD_MANAGER_APP`](https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/mobile-ads-sdk/android/quick-start#update_your_androidmanifestxml) into your `androidmanifest.xml` file.

Secondly, since we don't assume user's project will depend on this library, we use reflection to invoke its APIs. So the names of its classes can't be changed since reflection will use original name to find the class. You also need to add exception rules into your `proguard-android.txt` or `proguard-rules.pro`.

```
-keep class com.google.android.gms.ads.** { *; }
```

## Adding Carrier Information
You can set an option in the config object titled `getCarrierInfo` to retrieve carrier name for a device. This is the ( [`Config`](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-Flutter/blob/master/lib/src/config.dart)). This object can be passed as a constructor argument for additional options.

If you set `getCarrierInfo` to `true` - **recipients on Android devices will see a dialog box asking them for permission** . This dialog will say
`allow app to make and manage phone calls`. This is a message sent from the android operating system for the `READ_PHONE_STATE` permission and carrier info is grouped into this.
If the user denies permission - carrier information will not be retrieved. The new android operating systems require asking a user for permission before retrieving this information.

By default the Config will set `getCarrierInfo` will default to false.

An example can be found here [`Example`](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-Flutter/blob/chores/add-missing-device-data-wip/example/lib/my_app.dart#L30).

## Example

```dart
import 'package:amplitude_flutter/amplitude_flutter.dart';

// replace 'API_KEY' with your project's API_KEY
Future<void> example() async {
  final AmplitudeFlutter analytics = AmplitudeFlutter('API KEY');

  // set this user's id
  analytics.setUserId('abc123');

  // log an event
  analytics.logEvent(name: 'add_friend');

  // Log events with event properties
  analytics.logEvent(name: 'add_friend', properties: { 'event_properties': { 'key': 'value' }});

  // identify a user
  final Identify identify = Identify()
    ..set('cohort', 'Test A')
    ..setOnce('completed_onboarding', 'true')
    ..add('login_count', 1)
    ..append('tags', 'new tag')
    ..unset('demo_user');

  analytics.identify(identify);

  // Amplitude Accounts [https://amplitude.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001765532-Accounts] methods:
  // add a user to a group
  analytics.setGroup('orgId', 15);

  // change properties of a group
  analytics.groupIdentify('orgId', 15, Identify()..set('account_manager', 456));

  // emit an event associated with a group
  analytics.logEvent('Demo Released', properties: { 'groups': { 'orgId': 15 } });

  // Log revenue
  final Revenue revenue = Revenue()
    ..setPrice(23.23)
    ..setQuantity(3)
    ..setProductId('widget1')

  analytics.logRevenue(revenue);
}
```
